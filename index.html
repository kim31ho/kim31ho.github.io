				<h1>Profile</h1>

			<body>
				<p>Graduated from University of Utah in Information System Major.  I liked how information system was in between business and technology.<br>
				In todays world technology is huge and also takes big part in business as well.  This is one of the reason I was interested in Front End Developing.<br>
				You get to interact with customers to see what their business needs are and what they would want from website.  I got into Front End Developing due to <br>
				visual appearances.  Everything you change in the code changes the website which was main attraction for me.
